I'm working on a little personal project, quantifying what technologies are most asked for in Data Science JDs. Really I'm more using it to work on my Python chops. I'm hitting a slightly perplexing error and I think ChatGPT has taken me as far as it possibly can on this one.

Analyzing changes to gravel height along a road,Proof_Wrap_2150,datascience,4,4,5,,text,"I’m working with a dataset that measures the height of gravel along a 50 km stretch of road at 10-meter intervals. I have two measurements:
Baseline height: The original height of the gravel.
New height: A more recent measurement showing how the gravel has decreased over time.
This gives me the difference in height at various points along the road. I’d like to model this data to understand and predict gravel depletion.
Here’s what I’m considering:Identifying trends or patterns in gravel loss (e.",,,2025-01-21 19:02:10,19,negative,-0.3612,0.049,0.115,0.836,2025-12-24 10:36:53,thing_t3_1i6qa6u
